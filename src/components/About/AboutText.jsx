      I am a backend developer with 5 years of experience specializing in C#
      .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and API development. I have expertise in
      N-Tier Architecture, Onion Architecture, Repository Design Pattern, CQRS,
      and Mediator, ensuring scalable and maintainable software solutions. My
      database skills include SQL and T-SQL, along with implementing Identity

      In this process, I decided to improve myself especially in the field of
      Asp.Net Core MVC and I continue to attend various trainings to further
      develop the knowledge I have acquired. I love learning on my own and am
      always researching to learn more. In addition, I am open to taking part in
      different projects, improving myself on different subjects and gaining
      different perspectives.
